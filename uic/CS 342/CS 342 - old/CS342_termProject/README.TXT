PROJECT TITLE: 
    Dungeon crawling in CS 342
    
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
    To create a knock-off dungeon crawler game

VERSION or DATE: 
    9/13/18
    
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
    Make sure to have everything within the same
    folder and use the makeFile, if any at all.
    Run with make and run javac - the normal way of
    executing with make.

	Steps:
		1. Have the .java and .class files under the same
		   directory
		2. Take a good look at the makefile - it shows you
		   what will be compiled and made
		3. Type [ make ]
		4. See that it compiles - because I made sure it did
		   on many machines many many times
		5. Type [ java GameTester ] to run the game.
		6. Don't give me a failing grade on this.
		7. Step 6 but with more emphasis.

NOTES FOR THE GRADER:
    There are comments within the .java files - please read them to see
    the overall concept I am trying to evoke.
    
    I did not comment for basic things such as distinct variable names,
    setters and getters, and functions that are extremely easy to figure
    out on what they do. I assume that the person who is grading this to
    have fairly high intelligence to know basic things such as those.
    
    I hard coded the 6-dungeon room. It is messy. That's what hard coding does.
    
    I tried to use modern C++ style programming. You'll see it through the foreach
    loops and iterators, etc. that I used.
    
    The EXIT ID is 0 and not 1 as specified in the rubric - you'll see why if you
    read the comments.
    
IMPORTANT NOTES:
    I do not know what or how the program is supposed to be outputted. (e.g. not
    knowing if I should print "\n" or not) So if you are basing my grade on the accuracy
    and exactness of the output to some test cases or master key, you will be disappointed
    because this is not like code.io or repl.it where the output has to match exactly
    ...or does it?
    
    I error checked if the player is attempting to access a locked direction - do I get
    extra points?
    
    I used BlueJ for this.
