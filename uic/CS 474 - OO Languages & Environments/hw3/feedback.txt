Hi Jon,

Thanks for your submission, here are a few comments:

1. Good documentation and well commented. However, code is difficult to read as eveything is coded in one file. 
2. Implementation is functional. However it is not clear how you are using phantom type to make some options mandatory. I do not see compilation error when I remove a builder method. -1
3. I did not see examples of how user would use monadic combinators on command execution. -1
