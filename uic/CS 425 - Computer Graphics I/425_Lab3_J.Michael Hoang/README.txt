 How much of the project did I finish?

	I managed to only get the arithmetic involving ray tracing in addition to the necessary
	classes such as VectorsAndRays.cpp and Object.cpp to achieve that.

	The comments should help in understanding the code a bit.

	In short, I didn't put much time into this as I thought I wanted to - especially juggling every other class
	this semester and the finals and the anxiety that comes along with it...

	Sorry about that...

How did you create your classes and their functions?

	I pretty much read off of the book and tried to make sense of it - which is how I got to those
	functions. However, I couldn't seem to get it working correctly as all I see is a black screen and
	not whatever I wanted...
