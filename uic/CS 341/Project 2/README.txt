Steps on how to start project2.cpp:

1.  Compile and run it.
2.  Type in a [movies] file and hit return.
3.  Type in the corresponding [reviews] file
    and hit return.
    // Note I think review3 also corresponds with movies2
    // -- forgot.
4.  Wait for it to load because they can be pretty large
    files.
5. Voila.
