Welcome to my UIC repository!

Here, you will find most of the code for classes that I've taken
here at the university and any other side project during my time
here.

If you stumbled upon this place first and want to know more about me,
please feel free to go to the website listed under my bio.
If it's not there, here it is: [ https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jhoang ].

So please feel free to have a look around.
