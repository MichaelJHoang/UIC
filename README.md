#Welcome to my UIC repository!

**Here, you will find most of the code for classes that I've taken
here at the university and any other side project during my time
here.

If you stumbled upon this place first and want to know more about me,
please feel free to go to the website listed under my bio.
If it's not there, here it is: [ https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jhoang ]
When entering in the URL, please do include the whole thing otherwise
something weird happens.

As of 2019, I am now using my Raspberry Pi to push updates on this
repository instead of click and drag methods that I have used in
the past. The reason why I'm using my RPI for this is because
I can't SSH into the schools computers and use git from there and 
that for some reason, Windows (on my laptop, that is) won't allow 
such things to happen.

---

So please feel free to have a look around and if you so happen to stumble
upon this repository and use my code for answers for your class projects, 
I am not responsible if you get caught - which you should since you go to 
school to learn, not to cheat and that defeats the purpose of going to
school.**
